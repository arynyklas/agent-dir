# PR Reviewer Skill

Comprehensive pull request review skill that validates changes against project standards, runs quality gates, and provides structured feedback for merge decisions.

## When This Skill Activates

- Reviewing open pull requests
- Creating PR descriptions
- Validating changes before merge
- Checking CI/CD status
- Generating review summaries
- Approving or requesting changes

## PR Review Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context

```bash
# Get PR details
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json title,body,author,state,reviews,files,commits

# View the diff
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER>

# Check CI status
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER>

# Get commits
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json commits

# List changed files
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER> --name-only
```

### Step 2: Understand the Change

Questions to answer:
- What problem does this PR solve?
- What is the approach taken?
- What are the key changes?
- What might break?
- What tests were added?

### Step 3: Run Quality Gates

```bash
cd /home/user/Autonomous-Assignment-Program-Manager/backend

# Fetch and checkout PR
git fetch origin pull/<PR_NUMBER>/head:pr-<PR_NUMBER>
git checkout pr-<PR_NUMBER>

# Run quality checks
pytest --tb=short -q
ruff check app/ tests/
black --check app/ tests/
mypy app/ --python-version 3.11

# Check test coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-fail-under=70
```

### Step 4: Review Categories

#### A. Code Quality

- [ ] Type hints on all functions
- [ ] Docstrings on public APIs
- [ ] No magic numbers/hardcoded values
- [ ] DRY principle followed
- [ ] Appropriate error handling

#### B. Testing
- [ ] Tests added for new code
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases
- [ ] Tests are readable and maintainable
- [ ] Coverage >= 70%
- [ ] No flaky tests

#### C. Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] Auth checks in place
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs/errors
- [ ] SQL injection prevention

#### D. Architecture
- [ ] Follows project patterns
- [ ] Database changes have migrations
- [ ] Async/await used correctly
- [ ] Pydantic schemas for I/O
- [ ] No circular dependencies

#### E. Documentation
- [ ] PR description is clear
- [ ] Complex logic commented
- [ ] API docs updated if needed
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated for features
- [ ] **Code/comment consistency** - verify comments match actual behavior
- [ ] **Seed data alignment** - filter values match canonical data sources

## Review Decision Matrix

| Gate | Pass | Block |
|------|------|-------|
| Tests | All pass | Any failure |
| Linting | 0 errors | Any error |
| Types | 0 errors | Critical types missing |
| Security | No issues | Any vulnerability |
| Coverage | >= 70% | < 60% |
| Architecture | Follows patterns | Major violation |

## PR Feedback Format

def calculate_hours(assignments: list[Assignment]) -> float:
    """Calculate total hours from assignments."""
    return sum(a.hours for a in assignments)
```
````

## Common Review Patterns

### Missing Tests

```markdown
This new functionality needs test coverage.

**Files needing tests:**
- `src/services/new_service.py`

**Suggested test cases:**
1. Happy path - normal input
2. Edge case - empty input
3. Error case - invalid input
4. Integration - database operations
```

### Architecture Violation

```markdown
This violates the layered architecture pattern.

**Issue:** Business logic in route handler

**Current:**
```python
@router.post("/items")
async def create_item(data: ItemCreate, db: Session):
    # Business logic here (violation)
    if data.value > 100:
        data.value = 100
    item = Item(**data.dict())
    db.add(item)
```

**Should be:**
```python
# In service layer
async def create_item(db: Session, data: ItemCreate) -> Item:
    if data.value > 100:
        data.value = 100
    item = Item(**data.dict())
    db.add(item)
    return item

# In route
@router.post("/items")
async def create_item_route(data: ItemCreate, db: Session):
    return await create_item(db, data)
```
```

### Missing Type Hints

````markdown
Please add type hints to these functions:

```suggestion
async def get_schedule(
    db: AsyncSession,
    schedule_id: str
) -> Optional[Schedule]:
    """Retrieve a schedule by ID."""
    ...
```
````

## Lesson Learned: PR #442 (2025-12-26)

**What happened:** A fix changed a filter from one value to another, but the new value
was also incorrect because comments/docs said "outpatient" while code used "clinic".

**Prevention checklist for filter/constant changes:**
- [ ] Verify value against seed data (`scripts/seed_templates.py`)
- [ ] Check if comments describe different behavior than code implements
- [ ] Cross-reference with canonical data source (e.g., BLOCK_10_ROADMAP)
- [ ] Confirm the filter will actually find matching records

**Key insight:** Always ask "will this filter find what we expect?" and verify empirically.

## Escalation Rules

**Request human review when:**

1. Changes touch authentication/authorization
2. Database migrations involved
3. ACGME compliance logic affected
4. Breaking API changes
5. Complex business logic unclear
6. Performance-critical code
7. Third-party integration changes
8. **Filter/constant value changes** - verify against canonical data sources

**Can approve automatically:**

1. Documentation-only changes
2. Test additions (without code changes)
3. Dependency updates (minor versions)
4. Code formatting fixes
5. Comment improvements
